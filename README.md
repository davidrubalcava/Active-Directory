## Introduction

Active Directory is a critical component of many organizations' IT infrastructure, serving as the foundation for authentication, authorization, and management of resources. However, it is also a prime target for cyberattacks. This project aims to delve into the intricacies of Active Directory security, covering topics such as configuration best practices, monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.

## Project Overview

The project covers a wide range of topics related to Active Directory security, including:

- Secure configuration and hardening of Active Directory domains and forests.
- Implementation of privileged access management (PAM) solutions.
- Monitoring and auditing of Active Directory changes and events.
- Detection and mitigation of common Active Directory attacks, such as pass-the-hash and golden ticket attacks.
- Integration with other security technologies, such as SIEM solutions and endpoint detection and response (EDR) platforms.

Each section of the project includes practical guidance, code samples, and real-world examples to help you understand and implement effective security measures in your Active Directory environment.

## Features
